This is an Amazon-like storefront built with a MySQL database. 
The app will take orders from customers and deplete stock if the item has inventory or ask the user to replace an order if there is no inventory. 

NPM packages used are:
MySQL 
Inquirer

The customer interface will show the user the:
Product ID - which will be used to select the item the user would like to purchase
Product Name
Price 
After the user has selected an item, they will be asked how many they would like to purchase. 
If there is stock, the selection will be fulfilled and the total price will be displayed. 
Otherwise, it will say there insufficient stock and ask the user to reselect a product ID. 

Below is a video demonstrating how the app works and how the database is updated each time a sucessful selection is put through:
